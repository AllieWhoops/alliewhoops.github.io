In order to improve my C++ programming skills, I decided that I wanted to try and program a game from scratch in the language. I re-created Tetris in C++ using the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) graphics library. SFML is a multimedia graphics library built on OpenGL that (amongst other things) provides functions for creating windows, reading inputs and drawing shapes. I used this library to render a front-end for the game, and coded the back end functionality in base C++.

This project helped me to further understand C++ as a language, as well as manage project file structure and using CMake templates to configure builds. The Github repository for LiTetris can be found [here](https://github.com/AllieWhoops/Litetris).

# **CoopRPG (2024-2025)**

As part of my final year of my computer science degree, I had to undertake a project across the year. The prompt I chose to base this project on was 'a networked multiplayer game', as it aligned with my interest in the game development industry. The game I created was a turn-based RPG with roguelike elements (namely procedural level design and death resulting in a game-over state) for up to four players. To develop it, I used the Unity engine, writing scripts in C#. This helped me to gain a strong understanding of development and workflows in Unity, and get to grips with Unity's [Netcode for GameObjects](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about/) library.

The premise of the game is that the players take on the role of chickens on a farm, and they must brave the dangers of the farm (like rats, fleas and foxes) to reach the barn (a paradise where there are endless seeds to eat). They progress through levels and eventually reach the farmer, who is the final boss that guards the barn. There are four player classes that represent the four classic fantasy archetypes: the warrior (an armoured fighter), the mage (a wizard), the shadow (a rogue) and the cleric (a priest). Each of these classes have different abilities that allow them to contribute to combat in different ways.

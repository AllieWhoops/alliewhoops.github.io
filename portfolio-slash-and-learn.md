description: An overview of my GMTK Game Jam 2025 project, Slash & Learn!

# Background
I entered Gamemaker's Toolkit's (GMTK) 2025 game jam as a solo developer in order to improve my game development skills and creative instincts. The jam took place over four days in August, and had the starting prompt of 'loops'. I decided that I wanted to interpret this in the sense of time-loops, where time repeats until the player succeeds at a task.

My initial ideas were a puzzle platformer where the player uses the dead bodies of previous attempts to work through levels, or a hack-and-slash where the player can rewind time to avoid enemy attacks. I decided to go with the second one as it was more interesting to me, and I could better visualise what the gameplay would look like.

The basic concept was inspired by boss fights in games like Final Fantasy XIV, where players learn the mechanics of each encounter by dying and figuring out how to avoid dying next time. The player would have access to some means of reversing the flow of time in the game, undoing any damage that the player takes from enemies.

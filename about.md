My name is Allie Lewis and I'm a 22 year old programmer and game developer.

I am a 3rd year computer science student at the University of Reading. I am graduating this July and I am excited to go into either game programming or software development. I have been programming in one form or another since I was a young child (I started on Scratch when I was around 9 or 10!) and I've been going ever since.

My main hobby is tabletop roleplaying games, primarly Pathfinder 2nd Edition and D&D 5th Edition (though I'm a big fan of trying new systems when I get the chance). I've run two multi-year D&D games since 2020, and I've just started a new Pathfinder campaign recently. I'm planning to convert one of my one-shot adventures into a published product on Pathfinder Infinite.

I also play a lot of video games. I play Final Fantasy XIV and take part in high-end raiding as a Dragoon main. This year, I also really loved Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The music was incredible and once I got the hang of parrying, the gameplay was perfect. I also dabble in Pok√©mon VGC from time to time.

      <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>As part of my final year of my computer science degree, I had to undertake a project across the year. The prompt I chose to base this project on was ‘a networked multiplayer game’, as it aligned with my interest in the game development industry. The game I created was a turn-based RPG with roguelike elements (namely procedural level design and death resulting in a game-over state) for up to four players. To develop it, I used the Unity engine, writing scripts in C#. This helped me to gain a strong understanding of development and workflows in Unity, and get to grips with Unity’s <a href="https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about/">Netcode for GameObjects</a> library.</p>

<p>The premise of the game is that the players take on the role of chickens on a farm, and they must brave the dangers of the farm (like rats, fleas and foxes) to reach the barn (a paradise where there are endless seeds to eat). They progress through levels and eventually reach the farmer, who is the final boss that guards the barn. There are four player classes that represent the four classic fantasy archetypes: the warrior (an armoured fighter), the mage (a wizard), the shadow (a rogue) and the cleric (a priest). Each of these classes have different abilities that allow them to contribute to combat in different ways.</p>

<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<h3 id="functional-requirements">Functional Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The game must feature networked multiplayer gameplay.
    <ul>
      <li>The game uses a client-host model, where one game instance acts as both a client and the server.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The game needs to be able to handle connecting players together using Unity Relay.</li>
  <li>The game needs to handle player inputs client-side, and make any changes that don’t affect the game state occur only on that client.</li>
  <li>The game should facilitate player-to-player communication, through text communication.</li>
  <li>The game should be able to be resumed in the event of a player disconnect.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="non-functional-requirements">Non-Functional Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The game should be suitable for players with slower internet speeds.</li>
  <li>The game should have four player classes to facilitate playstyle customisation.</li>
  <li>The enemies should have different behaviours based on their intelligence level.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="design">Design</h1>
<h3 id="uml-class-diagrams">UML Class Diagrams</h3>
<p>This project has a lot of moving parts in many of the scenes, with many different classes interacting with each other. In order to keep the functionality and interactions clear, I created class diagrams for each of the major scenes in the game.</p>

<h4 id="fight-scene">Fight Scene</h4>
<p><a href="/assets/images/Fight Scene Class Diagram.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/Fight Scene Class Diagram.png" style="width:600px;display:block;margin:auto" /></a></p>

<p>The fight scene is responsible for handling the commands given by players during combat and displaying the encounter on the screen. The primary loop (which starts with action selection, transitions to action execution and turn cleanup, and then returns to action selection) is managed by the FightSceneHandler on the host’s instance of the game, as the host is the instance that also stores character and enemy data.</p>

<p>The client instances transmit the players’ commands, which get added to the ‘initiative list’ (a list of actions and related information such as user, target and action priority). Once all players have submitted actions (or the one-minute timer has expired), the FightSceneHandler requests an action from each Enemy before beginning action execution.</p>

<p>The PlayerConnectionHandler class is responsible for holding player information, including their entered name and character sheet. This character sheet is a container for various information used in the combat encounter, such as character statistics and special abilities. Each attack and ability (non-attacking actions that provide various boosts to characters) is stored as an AttackProfile or AbilityProfile respectively. These implement Unity’s INetworkSerializable interface, meaning they can be sent over the network between the host and clients.</p>

<h4 id="load-game-lobby">‘Load Game’ Lobby</h4>
<p><a href="/assets/images/Load Lobby Class Diagram.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/Load Lobby Class Diagram.png" style="width:600px;display:block;margin:auto" /></a></p>

<p>The ‘load game’ lobby is responsible for connecting players to a game that is loading a previously saved game (in the instance of a disconnect, for example). It needs to allow players to select which character they are playing and display this information to all players. When a player chooses which character is theirs, their character sheet is overwritten with the stored one.</p>

<p>The LoadLobbyController takes the list of loaded CharacterSheets from the SaveGameHandler and presents them to the players. Each player in turn gets to select one of the sheets, which is then copied to that player’s PlayerConnectionHandler serverside. It also changes the playerName NetworkVariable to the saved character name.</p>

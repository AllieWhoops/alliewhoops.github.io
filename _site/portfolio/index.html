      <p>This is a showcase of some of the development projects I have done. Some of these were part of university projects, whereas others are things I made to teach myself something new, or as part of a game jam. The projects I am most proud of (or learned the most from) have their own dedicated pages, and the smaller ones have summaries on this page.</p>

<p>I entered the 2025 Gamemaker’s Toolkit Game Jam as a solo developer. Taking the theme of ‘loops’, I developed a singleplayer hack-and-slash game which revolves around the player rewinding time to avoid attacks from enemies.</p>

<p>In order to improve my C++ programming skills, I decided that I wanted to try and program a game from scratch in the language. I re-created Tetris in C++ using the <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a> multimedia graphics library, which is built on OpenGL.</p>

<p>For my degree project in my final year of university, I created an online turn-based RPG in Unity with C# and wrote my dissertation on the development process. It utilised the <a href="https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about/">Netcode for GameObjects</a> library and the <a href="https://docs.unity.com/ugs/manual/relay/manual/introduction">Unity Relay</a> service.</p>

<p>As a group project in my module on VR, graphics and games, I worked on an educational puzzle game with four other students. The game was coded in C# and used the Unity game engine. We created several computer-science-themed puzzles involving skills like binary-hexadecimal conversion and bit shifting, and placed them in an environment based on one of the buildings on the university campus.</p>

<p>My role was both puzzle design and implementation of the game’s inventory system, required for players to pick up keys and useful items like torches. The project received a high grade, and the university faculty requested to use the project as a display to prospective students at university open days.</p>

<p>The game used Unity’s HD render pipeline to allow for immersive and spooky graphics despite the low polygon count of the objects designed. This atmosphere helped contribute to the ‘escape-room’ feel we were trying to provide.</p>

<p>As an assignment for my VR, graphics and games module, I was tasked with creating a virtual building in Unity. I decided to recreate the precinct office from the sitcom <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>. I used Unity’s <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.probuilder@6.0/manual/index.html">ProBuilder</a> library to manipulate basic shapes to model the building and included a number of additional interaction features to the world with C# scripts, notably a microwave and elevator starting area. I also played around with Unity’s lighting settings to properly emulate the building’s interior light, as well as the setting sun on the skyline.</p>

<p>This project was my first time using the Unity Engine to make a 3D enviroment, and helped me to understand how to rapidly prototype levels and other 3D spaces in the engine. It was also useful to familiarise myself with the lighting and rendering parts of Unity that I hadn’t interacted with much before.</p>

<p>For my Java Programming module at university, I was asked to make an app using Java and Android Studio. I decided to combine my interests in game development and Dungeons &amp; Dragons to produce a daily puzzle game in the vein of <em>Wordle</em>. The game provides the player with a series of clues towards a spell from D&amp;D’s 5th Edition. The player has a total of 5 guesses they can make before they lose, and the game uses Google Firebase to handle user accounts that track a player’s win streak.</p>

<p>This project helped me improve my familiarity with the Java language and object-oriented design. It also taught me about design considerations to be made for non-desktop environments (like a phone or tablet).</p>

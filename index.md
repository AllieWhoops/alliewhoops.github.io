# **Something new in the works...**
> 29.08.2025

I've started work on a new game demo. I don't have much to show just yet, but it involves deciphering ancient texts and pulling information off of pages to solve puzzles. More updates soon!

# **Check out my latest project!**

I recently took part in the [2025 GMTK Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025), where I produced a small hack-and-slash game revolving around rewinding time to avoid enemy attacks. Check it out below, or see the portfolio page (coming soon!) to learn more about the development process.
